**e.g.**
```
media\background.png
media\list\listfocus.png

2. Edit path in texturePacker-build.bat to match your ```\media\path``` and change the output name for the ```<filename>.xbt``` you wish.
3. Double click the TexturePacker-Build.bat to run the TexturePacker.exe check if no errors occurred.

:ledger: For themes you can include a color.xml and a wallpaper.jpg named same as the <filename>.xbt in these paths.
```
someskin.here\backgrounds\mytheme.jpg
someskin.here\colors\mytheme.xml
someskin.here\colors\mytheme.xml
```
 
Place the resulting <filename>.xbt and other files as above and change the theme via Settings > Appearance > Skin
